
what is a 1-wire configure command?

A 1-Wire configure command is a special command sent to a 1-Wire slave device to change its behavior or settings. Some common things that configure commands may do include:

Change device address - Commands to set a new unique address for the slave device. Usually requires a password or authorization.

Set operating mode - Commands to change a device between modes like normal operation, sleep, idle, etc. This may change its power consumption or available functionality.

Enable/disable features - Commands to turn on or off certain features of the device like alarm signaling, temperature conversions, data logging, etc.

Calibration - Special commands to calibrate the device for maximum accuracy. This may involve providing reference voltages/currents or known temperature points.

Restore factory defaults - A command to reset all device settings back to factory defaults. Useful if the device gets into an unknown state.

Read/write scratchpad - Some devices have a small scratchpad memory that can be read and written with commands. This could be used to store simple device settings or user data.

Password operations - Commands to set a device password for authorization, or clear an existing password. Helpful for securing a device from unauthorized changes.

Examples of 1-Wire configure commands:

DS2431 1KB memory chip: SKIP ROM, WRITE MEMORY, READ MEMORY to access scratchpad
DS2406 dual addressable switch: SKIP ROM, CHANNEL ACCESS, CHANNEL ON/OFF to control switches
DS2438 battery monitor: SKIP ROM, CONVERT TEMP, CONVERT AD to request conversions
DS2450 quad A/D: SKIP ROM, START CONVERSION to begin A/D reading
DS28EC20 20kb memory chip: SKIP ROM, APPEND POTECTOR, AUTH PASSWORD for security
Usually 1-Wire configure commands are sent after a device reset, and begin with a SKIP ROM to address all devices, followed by the specific configure command, and any command-specific data bytes. Let me know if you have any other questions!

DS18B20 temperature sensor - Very popular, needs CONVERT T and READ POWER SUPPLY commands.

DS1822/DS18S20 temperature sensors - Also common, similar commands to DS18B20.

DS2423 counter - Needs COUNTER READ and COUNTER INCREMENT commands. Useful for keeping track of cycles or operations.

DS2438 battery sensor - Requires CONVERT VAD and CONVERT TAD to get voltage, current and temperature readings. Helpful for monitoring battery-powered projects.

DS2450 1-Wire digital potentiometer - Needs READ POT and WRITE POT commands to set the wiper position. Can be used as a simple analog adjustment.

DS2431 1kb EEPROM - Requires READ MEMORY and WRITE MEMORY to access storage. Simple persistent data storage for a device.

DS2502 1kb EEPROM with 16kb pages - Similar to DS2431 but with paged memory for greater capacity.

DS2423 counter - Increments on command, can count events or operations. Needs INCREMENT COUNTER and READ COUNTER commands.

DS2413 I/O expander - Provides 2 inputs and outputs, addressed individually. Needs CHANNEL READ and CHANNEL WRITE commands to access each I/O pin.

By implementing the necessary configure and access commands for these useful chips, esphome can provide simple interfaces to integrate them into projects. Let me know if you have any other questions!

I see, rather than writing a specific component for each 1-Wire device, you want to provide a more generic 1-Wire base with the necessary protocol methods and commands, and allow users to customize behavior for specific chips using lambdas and callbacks. This is a great approach!

Some things you could provide in a generic 1-Wire base include:

Device scan/search to detect 1-Wire chips on the bus
Device selection/skip ROM commands to choose a specific device
Basic device information like type code, serial number, etc.
Scratchpad read/write to access any scratchpad memory
Memory read/write for devices with addressable memory arrays
CRC generation/checking for error detection
Timing parameters and delay functions for accurate bit timing
Reset pulse to put all devices into a known state
Interrupt handling for devices that support it
Then users could build on this in their esphome code with lambdas to handle chip-specific functionality like:

DS18B20 temperature conversion and reading
DS2423 counter incrementing and value reading
DS2413 I/O pin reading and writing
DS2450 potentiometer reading and wiper position setting
Password operations or special calibration on supported chips
And so on...
So the esphome code for a project using some 1-Wire devices may look something like this:

yaml
Copy
# Generic 1-Wire base 
one_wire:
  pin: GPIO23

# DS18B20 temperature sensor  
sensor:
  - platform: dallas
    pin: one_wire 
    address: 0x28 
    lambda: |-  
      one_wire.select_device(0x28)
      one_wire.send_command(0x44) // CONVERT T  
      ...

# DS2423 event counter
sensor: 
  - platform: dallas
    pin: one_wire
    address: 0x25
    lambda: |-  
      counter = one_wire.read_memory(0x0000)  // Read counter 
      one_wire.send_command(0x41) // INCREMENT COUNTER  
      ...
This allows you to provide a lot of reusability for common 1-Wire functionality, while still keeping components flexible enough for users to customize for their specific chips. Let me know if this helps explain the approach, or if you have any other questions!
